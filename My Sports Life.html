<P> Sports are my favorite thing in life. Whether its playing the sport or simply watching it, I just have always loved sports. During high school I was on the golf team and basketball team for 4 years, but I hav also played hockey my entire life. Weirdly enough my favorite sport of all, is one I do not actually play; baseball.
